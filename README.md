*Welcome* 👋

Hi, I'm Marcos, known here on GitHub as @Fyxr17.

👀 I am interested in learning to be a good backend developer and become useful in the technology market.

🌱 I am currently learning languages ​​like JajaScript (in the backend part of web development) as my main language and Python as a secondary language. I worked as an intern for the DOMINICAN SOCIETY OF PERFORMERS AND ARTISTS (SODAIE) where they helped me learn node.js and most of its tools.
 
💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects in which I can develop necessary skills for myself and be able to complete my objectives in the workplace.

*Skills* 🎯
- JavaScritp 📜
- Python 🐍
